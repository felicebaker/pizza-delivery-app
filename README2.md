# pizza-delivery-app

# This is a Django project I completed on May 29, 2015 as a remote subcontractor for a software firm in Santa Cruz, California.

# It is an up-and-coming pizza delivery app that makes use of the following APIs:

# a) Twilio SMS (text-messaging)
# b) Authorize.net (transaction authorization)
# c) Google Distance Matrix API (distance calculation between geographic points)
# d) GeoCoder (validation of physical addresses)

# I will not outline the algorithm for the project because I am bound by an NDA. However, if you look in the views.py file
# within the views application, you will see the code for all of the project's views, and will get a good sense of my
# expertise in Django and API integration with Django.
